# Problems Faced

* While scraping and parsing there was difficulty  in detecting the changes occuring in notification section of the website.
* Whatsapp messaging API i.e. Twilio wasn't working and was throwing "error:500" so we switched to it's alternative i.e. Telegram API.
* After detecting the change , converting the new notification from HTML to doc. was quite challenging.
* While deploying our code on web server we faced lot of errors.
